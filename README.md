# work-day-scheduler
A clander scheduler using APIs

# Description
This homework project takes a jquery API to create a weekly scheduler that has input fields and events that the user can edit and then send to local storage. We are given starting code for the HTML, CSS, and JavaSctipt files. We were then tasked to create the functionality with the API to be able to edit and save events on the schedule.

# Instilation 
This site will be deployed through GitHub: https://mj470.github.io/work-day-scheduler/

# Usage
This is a helpful application built through an API. This app should update to the current date. It will also have an hourly schedule with text fields open for user input.

 These inputs can be saved to local storage. When the time slot has passed, the color will change to red once it is in the past. The application should also save entered events when the page is reloaded.

All of these features work to geter to create a simple and functional scheduler. 

# Credits 
I got a lot of help from previous students on youtube, and my current cohort on how to put in specific loops and even listeners.
